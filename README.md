# T-Shirt Mockup Generator

Welcome to the T-Shirt Mockup Generator project! This tool enables you to create stunning t-shirt mockups quickly and easily. It's powered by Fabric.js, a powerful HTML5 canvas library, and is designed to help you design and visualize custom t-shirts in just a few clicks.

- **Simple Interface**: Designed for ease of use, even for beginners.
- **Customizable Templates**: Choose from various t-shirt mockup templates and designs.

## How It Works

This tool is built using **Fabric.js**, a versatile JavaScript library for working with canvas elements. Fabric.js allows the creation, manipulation, and rendering of shapes, images, and text on HTML5 canvases, making it an ideal choice for building interactive design tools like the T-shirt Mockup Generator.

### Key Features of Fabric.js Used:

1. **Canvas-based UI**: The entire mockup generator is rendered on an HTML5 canvas, providing a high level of flexibility and performance.
2. **Image Manipulation**: Fabric.js allows users to upload images and place them on the canvas. This includes adjusting position, scaling, and rotating graphics, which are essential for t-shirt design mockups.
3. **Text Editing**: Users can add and customize text (font, color, size, etc.) to their t-shirt designs in real-time.
4. **Object Layers**: With Fabric.js, objects are stacked in layers, which makes it easier to organize and manipulate multiple elements like logos, artwork, and text.
5. **Export Functionality**: After creating a custom mockup, the generator allows users to export the design as a high-resolution image file, ready for printing or marketing.

### Steps to Build the Mockup Generator:

1. **Canvas Setup**: The mockup is displayed on an HTML5 canvas. Fabric.js is initialized with a canvas object that serves as the design area.
2. **File Upload**: Users can upload images (such as their t-shirt design) which are placed onto the canvas. Fabric.js handles all the image rendering and scaling.
3. **Text Tools**: The text editor allows users to input custom text, which is rendered on the t-shirt mockup. Fabric.js enables the modification of text properties like font family, color, and size.
4. **Mockup Rendering**: The t-shirt is rendered as a background image on the canvas, with user uploads or edits placed on top. This gives the user a live preview of their design.
5. **Export & Save**: Once the design is finalized, users can download the mockup image as a PNG or JPEG file.

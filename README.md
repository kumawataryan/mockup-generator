# Mockup Generator

The **Mockup Generator** is a web-based tool that allows users to create custom mockups for their design projects. It leverages the powerful capabilities of **Fabric.js** to provide an interactive and easy-to-use canvas for adding images, text, and other elements to mockup templates. The goal of the project is to allow designers to quickly and easily create mockups without needing advanced design skills or software.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Canvas**: Use the canvas to place and manipulate elements like text, images, shapes, and more.
- **Customizable Templates**: Choose from a variety of pre-built mockup templates and customize them according to your needs.
- **Export Options**: Once you've created your perfect mockup, download or share it directly from the platform.
- **Easy-to-Use**: With an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, users can quickly create professional mockups without complex tools.

## How it Works

The **Mockup Generator** was built using **Fabric.js**, a powerful HTML5 canvas library that simplifies working with complex elements like objects, images, and shapes. It enables smooth and real-time rendering of objects on the canvas. 

### Key Components of the Application

- **Fabric.js**: The core of the tool, enabling interactive canvas management. Fabric.js allows for easy manipulation of elements like resizing, rotation, and layer management.
- **Canvas**: The main workspace where users can drag and drop elements, resize, move, and edit them.
- **Image and Text Editing**: The tool supports uploading and editing images, adding text with various fonts and styles, and even adjusting properties like opacity, rotation, and position.
- **Export Functionality**: After designing the mockup, the canvas can be exported as an image file to be shared or used in your design workflows.
